Sentiment-Based Satisfaction Rating Prediction
Overview
This project aims to analyze customer reviews and predict satisfaction ratings (on a scale of 1 to 5) using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The workflow is broken down into three main steps:

Steps
1. Sentiment Analysis
Use a pre-trained large language model (LLM) such as BERT, RoBERTa, or similar to perform sentiment analysis. The sentiment of each review is classified into one of the following categories:

Positive

Negative

Neutral

2. Feature Extraction
Extract semantic features from the review texts using embeddings generated by the LLM. These embeddings serve as input features for the next stage.

3. Model Building
Build a classification model to predict the satisfaction rating (1 to 5) based on the extracted features. You can experiment with machine learning models such as:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

How to Use
Preprocess the reviews – Clean and tokenize the text.

Run sentiment analysis – Use a transformer model to classify sentiments.

Extract embeddings – Use the same model or another transformer to extract text embeddings.

Train the model – Use scikit-learn or a similar library to train your classifier.

Evaluate – Measure model accuracy, F1-score, or other relevant metrics.

Requirements
